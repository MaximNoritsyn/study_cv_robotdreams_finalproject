## Discription
I emulated the security camera from youtube video [LIVE NYC's Times Square!, | Usa , | world famous street-level camera | World Live Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbsxuwwAiDI&t)
create a dataset of images and try to encode this dataset into small file and after that can be reconstructed like the first source
